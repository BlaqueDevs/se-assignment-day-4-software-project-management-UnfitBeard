Security vulnerabilities can lead to breaches and data loss
Technical debt accumulates and slows future development
High-quality code is easier to maintain and extend
User experience directly impacts adoption and retention
Rework is more expensive than getting it right first time
Reliable software provides business continuity
High standards improve team morale and pride in work
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope contributes to successful planning by:

Clarifying exactly what will (and won't) be delivered
Establishing boundaries and preventing scope creep
Enabling accurate resource allocation and scheduling
Setting realistic expectations with stakeholders
Providing a baseline for change management
Facilitating more accurate cost and time estimates
Aligning team understanding of project goals

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. It breaks down complex projects into smaller, manageable components.
A WBS is useful because it:

Makes complex projects more manageable by breaking them into digestible chunks
Creates clear work packages that can be assigned to team members
Helps identify all necessary deliverables and prevent omissions
Provides a foundation for scheduling, budgeting, and resource planning
Facilitates better estimation of effort, cost, and duration
Enables effective progress tracking and reporting
Creates a clear visual representation of the project structure
Helps identify dependencies between different parts of the project
Forms the basis for risk assessment at component levels
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of developing a detailed project schedule:

Provides clear timelines and deadlines for deliverables
Helps identify dependencies between tasks
Allows for efficient resource allocation
Enables early identification of potential bottlenecks
Facilitates coordination between team members
Provides a baseline for tracking progress
Helps manage stakeholder expectations
Allows for optimization of the development process
Enables proactive risk management
Supports informed decision-making

Gantt charts assist in this process by:

Visualizing the project timeline in an easy-to-understand format
Showing task dependencies with connecting lines
Displaying task durations as horizontal bars
